            A BS Computer Science student from University of the Philippines - Los Ba√±os (UPLB), specializing in Frontend Software Engineering. Since high school, I've been interested in technology. It started when I tried building websites using a site-builder and became curious about what really happens behind the scenes. I explored different careers that aligned with my interests and chose Software Engineering. This career path resonated with my passion, and the opportunities it offered solidified my decision to pursue it.
            <br><br>Pursuing a BS in Computer Science has been a fruitful journey. It has significantly enhanced my programming, analytical, and problem-solving skills. I have learned fundamental and advanced programming concepts and applied them through hands-on academic exercises and projects. Throughout my studies, I have expanded my knowledge in several programming languages, including Python, C, R for data science, and Java. Additionally, I have gained experience in designing and developing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using frameworks like JavaFX and Shiny.
