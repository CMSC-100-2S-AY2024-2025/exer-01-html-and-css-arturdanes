**A R A** is my personal portfolio. It is a static single-page website that consists of my autobiography, profile, 
skills in management and programming, and details about my previous projects. This project was created for me to showcase my skills
as a software developer. 

You can access the website through this [link](https://github.com/CMSC-100-2S-AY2024-2025/exer-01-html-and-css-arturdanes.git).
