**Author**: Arabela R. Turdanes

**Degree Program**: BS Computer Science


**A R A** is my personal portfolio. It is a static single-page website that consists of my autobiography, profile, 
skills in management and programming, and details about my previous projects. This project was created for me to showcase my skills
as a software developer. 

You can access the website through this [link](https://cmsc-100-2s-ay2024-2025.github.io/exer-01-html-and-css-arturdanes/).

# Steps on how to create GitHub page

**Project Site**

If you already have an existing repository, click the 'Settings'. 

After that, go to the GitHub Pages section and set main as your source. Then, click 'Save'. You can also choose a theme.

Then, you can commit your changes with a commit comment/message.

Finally, you can go to your project site at http://username.github.io/repository.

# My Takeaways from this Project

First of all, I'm really not familiar with Git and Github. My repositories are always stored in my personal computer and
some remote storage like the Google Drive. Now, I'm still barely keeping up but I'm trying my best.

Through this project, I learned how to make my own portfolio, showcasing my skills, and create GitHub Pages.
I also learned how to commit and push my repo changes to my remote repository.

It's a new concept but a more convenient one.
